                    <p>A deontological approach to ethical decision making 
                        begins with reasoning our way to understanding the 
                        moral law that should govern the decision.  Kant called 
                        these moral laws categorical (universal, timeless) 
                        imperatives (must do’s that are not optional).  To begin, 
                        consider the reasons supporting each option.</p>

                            <p>
                                The fundamental principle of our moral duties is a 
                                categorical imperative.
                                •It is an imperative because it is a command addressed 
                                to agents who could follow it but might not
                                •It is categorical in virtue of applying to us 
                                unconditionally – in all times and all places
                                Unlike hypothetical imperatives, categorical imperatives 
                                are not relative to a desire or goal

                                however, the law must be defined, universal and consistent.
